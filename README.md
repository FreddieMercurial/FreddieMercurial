ðŸ”­ **Current Projects**

I started an Open Source/FOSS Guild called "[Digital Defiance](https://digitaldefiance.org)" ([GitHub](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance)), a non-profit incorporated in Washington State and officially 501(c)(3). It has absorbed most of my projects. We're actively working on several exciting endeavors:

- **Connect with Us:**
  - Keybase: [keybase.io/team/digitaldefiance](https://keybase.io/team/digitaldefiance)
  - Discord: [discord.gg/8ASAAxzyyM](https://discord.gg/8ASAAxzyyM)

I'm always working on side projects and enjoy starting new things. I usually circle back to projects eventually. Currently, I'm reviving some projects and focusing on:

- TypeScript projects are in [NX](https://nx.dev/) based monorepos and typically MERN stacks
- Several secret projects currently in private repos, which will be open source upon release. Keep an eye on the [Digital Defiance](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance) organization for updates.

**Highlighted Projects:**

  - [BrightChain - MERN](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/BrightChain)
  - [Dominion Assistant - React](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/DominionAssistant)
  - [OpenBook - NodeJS](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/OpenBook)
  - [Chili and Cilantro - MERN](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/chili-and-cilantro)

My older projects aren't totally abandonedâ€”some are ideas I've thought about and may interest you. I will likely revisit them. Most are ideas in search of an audience.
